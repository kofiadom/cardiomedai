# Comprehensive Guide to Hypertension Management

## What is Hypertension?

Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition where the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It is often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms but can lead to serious health complications if left untreated.

## Blood Pressure Categories

According to the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines:

### Normal Blood Pressure
- **Systolic**: Less than 120 mmHg
- **Diastolic**: Less than 80 mmHg
- **Reading**: <120/80 mmHg

### Elevated Blood Pressure
- **Systolic**: 120-129 mmHg
- **Diastolic**: Less than 80 mmHg
- **Reading**: 120-129/<80 mmHg

### Stage 1 Hypertension
- **Systolic**: 130-139 mmHg
- **Diastolic**: 80-89 mmHg
- **Reading**: 130-139/80-89 mmHg

### Stage 2 Hypertension
- **Systolic**: 140 mmHg or higher
- **Diastolic**: 90 mmHg or higher
- **Reading**: ≥140/≥90 mmHg

### Hypertensive Crisis
- **Systolic**: Higher than 180 mmHg
- **Diastolic**: Higher than 120 mmHg
- **Reading**: >180/>120 mmHg
- **Action**: Seek immediate medical attention

## Risk Factors

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors
- **Age**: Risk increases with age
- **Gender**: Men are at higher risk until age 45; women after menopause
- **Race**: African Americans have higher rates
- **Family History**: Genetic predisposition
- **Chronic Kidney Disease**: Affects blood pressure regulation

### Modifiable Risk Factors
- **Diet**: High sodium, low potassium intake
- **Physical Inactivity**: Sedentary lifestyle
- **Obesity**: BMI ≥30 kg/m²
- **Smoking**: Damages blood vessels
- **Excessive Alcohol**: More than moderate consumption
- **Stress**: Chronic stress can contribute
- **Sleep Disorders**: Sleep apnea affects blood pressure

## Lifestyle Modifications

### Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH Diet)
- **Fruits and Vegetables**: 4-5 servings each per day
- **Whole Grains**: 6-8 servings per day
- **Lean Proteins**: Fish, poultry, beans
- **Low-Fat Dairy**: 2-3 servings per day
- **Nuts and Seeds**: 4-5 servings per week
- **Limited Sodium**: <2,300 mg/day (ideally <1,500 mg/day)
- **Limited Saturated Fat**: <6% of total calories

### Physical Activity
- **Aerobic Exercise**: 150 minutes moderate intensity per week
- **Resistance Training**: 2-3 days per week
- **Examples**: Brisk walking, swimming, cycling, dancing
- **Benefits**: Can reduce systolic BP by 4-9 mmHg

### Weight Management
- **Target**: BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m²
- **Weight Loss**: 1-2 pounds per week is safe
- **Impact**: 1 kg weight loss can reduce BP by 1 mmHg

### Stress Management
- **Techniques**: Meditation, deep breathing, yoga
- **Regular Sleep**: 7-9 hours per night
- **Social Support**: Maintain healthy relationships
- **Time Management**: Reduce work-related stress

### Alcohol and Smoking
- **Alcohol Limit**: Men ≤2 drinks/day, Women ≤1 drink/day
- **Smoking Cessation**: Complete cessation recommended
- **Benefits**: Immediate improvement in cardiovascular health

## Medications

### ACE Inhibitors
- **Examples**: Lisinopril, Enalapril, Captopril
- **Mechanism**: Block angiotensin-converting enzyme
- **Side Effects**: Dry cough, hyperkalemia, angioedema
- **Monitoring**: Kidney function, potassium levels

### Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)
- **Examples**: Losartan, Valsartan, Olmesartan
- **Mechanism**: Block angiotensin II receptors
- **Side Effects**: Similar to ACE inhibitors but less cough
- **Benefits**: Good for diabetic patients

### Calcium Channel Blockers
- **Examples**: Amlodipine, Nifedipine, Diltiazem
- **Mechanism**: Block calcium channels in blood vessels
- **Side Effects**: Ankle swelling, constipation, gum hyperplasia
- **Types**: Dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines

### Diuretics
- **Examples**: Hydrochlorothiazide, Chlorthalidone, Furosemide
- **Mechanism**: Reduce blood volume by increasing urine output
- **Side Effects**: Electrolyte imbalances, dehydration
- **Monitoring**: Kidney function, electrolytes

### Beta-Blockers
- **Examples**: Metoprolol, Atenolol, Propranolol
- **Mechanism**: Block beta-adrenergic receptors
- **Side Effects**: Fatigue, cold extremities, bradycardia
- **Contraindications**: Asthma, severe COPD

## Monitoring and Follow-up

### Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
- **Frequency**: Daily for newly diagnosed, weekly for controlled
- **Timing**: Same time each day, preferably morning
- **Technique**: Proper cuff size, arm at heart level, rest 5 minutes
- **Record Keeping**: Log readings for healthcare provider

### Healthcare Visits
- **Initial**: Every 2-4 weeks until controlled
- **Stable**: Every 3-6 months
- **Assessments**: BP measurement, medication review, side effects
- **Lab Tests**: Kidney function, electrolytes, lipids

### Target Blood Pressure Goals
- **General Population**: <130/80 mmHg
- **Diabetes**: <130/80 mmHg
- **Chronic Kidney Disease**: <130/80 mmHg
- **Elderly (≥65 years)**: <130/80 mmHg if tolerated

## Complications of Untreated Hypertension

### Cardiovascular Complications
- **Heart Attack**: Myocardial infarction
- **Heart Failure**: Reduced pumping capacity
- **Stroke**: Ischemic or hemorrhagic
- **Peripheral Artery Disease**: Reduced blood flow to limbs

### Organ Damage
- **Kidney Disease**: Chronic kidney disease, kidney failure
- **Eye Problems**: Retinopathy, vision loss
- **Brain**: Cognitive decline, dementia
- **Blood Vessels**: Atherosclerosis, aneurysms

## Special Populations

### Pregnancy
- **Gestational Hypertension**: Develops after 20 weeks
- **Preeclampsia**: Hypertension with proteinuria
- **Treatment**: Methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine
- **Monitoring**: Frequent prenatal visits

### Elderly Patients
- **Considerations**: Isolated systolic hypertension common
- **Treatment**: Start low, go slow approach
- **Monitoring**: Fall risk, cognitive function
- **Goals**: Balance benefits and risks

### Diabetes
- **Target**: <130/80 mmHg
- **Preferred**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs
- **Benefits**: Kidney protection
- **Monitoring**: Blood glucose, kidney function

## Emergency Situations

### Hypertensive Crisis
- **Symptoms**: Severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath
- **Action**: Call emergency services immediately
- **Treatment**: Gradual BP reduction in hospital setting
- **Complications**: Stroke, heart attack, kidney failure

### When to Seek Medical Attention
- **Blood Pressure**: >180/120 mmHg

- **Pregnancy**: Any elevation in blood pressure

## Prevention

### Primary Prevention
